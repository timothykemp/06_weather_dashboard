# 06_weather_dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard web application was my sixth homework assignment in the KU Coding Boot Camp. The purpose of this assignment was to put together everything I had learned so far into a single assignment. All of this had to be coded from scratch to meet the requirements. This assignment also involved utilizing a Server-Side API to obtain weather data from OpenWeather.

## Acceptance Criteria

The application itself had the following Acceptance Criteria:

```text
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
